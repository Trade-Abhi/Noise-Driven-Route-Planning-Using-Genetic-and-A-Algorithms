Abstract- The Primary objective of this research is to find the optimal path between the two points by incorporating the noise and distance as the decision variable. The research involves collecting geotagged sound samples and characterizing their noise levels to be used as a path weighing factor. The proposed algorithm i.e., Genetic and A* are employed to generate optimal route maps that minimize the both noise and distance for various time domains. The study points out the significance of taking sound into account while planning routes and the possible advantages of using noise-driven pathfinding algorithms. In this research, the best path was determined by minimizing noise levels and travel distance using a Genetic algorithm and the A* algorithm.
